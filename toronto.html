# Hi Anshul, Welcome to Toronto!
This page serves as your personal tour guide, offering tips and highlighting several great places I've explored. Keep in mind, it's heavily influenced by my own preferences!
## Life in toronto
### Overview of Toronto
Toronto is a city that borders Lake Ontario to the south. However, when we say the word "Toronto", it could mean the Toronto city, or GTA: the Greater Toronto Area. GTA has several major cities:
- Toronto city
- North: Vaughan, Richmond Hill, Markham
- West: Brampton, Missisauga
### Transport
#### Highways
The highways are pretty simple to understand. 
- 401 and 404, two N-S bound HWYs
The south part of 404 is connecting to DVP(Don Valley Parkway) connecting to Toronto downtown.
- 401, QEW(Queen Elizabeth Way) two E-W bound HWYs. 
- The only highway with toll is 407: remember, **never take 407!**  
#### TTC, GO train and presto card
One prepaid presto card can be used to take TTC and Go train in case you need it. TTC includes subway and buses. If you live in the downtown Toronto, TTC is pretty convinient. You can find maps anywhere, such as [The official website](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Images/Home/Routes-and-Schedules/Landing-page-pdfs/TTC_SubwayStreetcarMap_2021-11.pdf?rev=b9ab97e4c76549549c0cb09c210c508e).
#### Rental cars
Enterprise and Avis you can use the company code to have a discount. Remember to bring you badge.
### Groceries
I am not very familiar with Downtown Toronto area but sure you can find many stores. Besides, there is a high chance you can find an authentic Indian market somewhere!
### Drugs and health care
Equivilant to CVS or Walgreen, in Canada we have "Shoppers Drug Mart". If you need any medicine, go for it. You may also want to find a family doctor that will provide basic health care if case you need any type of help. My previous health care is the [Atlas medical clinic](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ptazoYmzhW9ehCd5A), but it might be too far from your place.

## Interesting destinations
Here is the fun part: where to spend your beautiful summer weekends. 
### DT toronto, Recommendation: 5
- [CN Tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ghLnMAV8fUB2SKLy7). Part of city skyline.
- [Ripley's Aquarium](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gNYPe5gUEfDMcW6w9)
- [Toronto Old City Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oYv7kFVW6AfWpnjc7). The old city hall as a landmark.
- Path: the underground city. There is no map but it is beneth the DT toronto CBD. If you can find the Mos Mos coffee, try that!
### Casa loma, [Address](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zRffiVMLCqFT3PJi9), Recommendation: 5
- Transport
Car, TTC, Uber
- Personal comment
Good place to spend your afternoon. An elegant castle used to be owned by a reach family. It is almost the most expensive place couples wants to host their wedding, heard it will easily cost 100k+ CAD. Annie and me took some photos there - there is one that hanging in our home you might remember.

### Icecreams
- iHalo
- Bang Bang Ice Cream & Bakery

### Restaurant
- [Aroma Fine Indian Cuisine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DK9mPid7XqVNFzGb9), my favorate Indian place. They used to offer workday lunch AYCE before covid but not sure about now.
### Niagara Falls, Recommendation: 5
- Transport
Car, ~1.5h from Toronto
- Personal comment
This place does not need comment. Departure in the morning and go home full with joy in the evening. You may want to try [BeaverTails](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zDC4DYvUAvmevPLM9) there: many Canadian kids' favorate snack.

### Blue mountains, Recommendation: 4
Perfect place to ski during the winter and chill during the summer. There is a playground setup during summer time including mini golf, rail runner coaster etc. A day pass is a good choice to enjoy all of them!
### The Bruce Peninsula, [Address](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fo4E9Np4fCMwVgt78), Recommendation: 5
3h drive from Toronto. Best time is any day in the summer. The peninsula is a beautiful place. Prepare 2-3 days, at least. Sauble Beach and Lion's Head are beautiful. But the Grotto in the Bruce Peninsula National Park is a place you must go. Another place you should not miss is the flowerpot island. Take the [Bruce Anchor Cruises Dock](https://maps.app.goo.gl/H1pLrEFg8SB1XNAX8) to get there.
### Algonquin Provincial Park, [Address](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vM33WfPn7d91LHPT6), Recommendation: 5
Be there between the labor day in September and the long weekend in Oct, to see the beautiful maple leaves. Better to plan for a 2 days trip. The [Lookout Trail](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HUhm1VEaGZ5tnHYs5) is my favorate, and I know a road that full of yellow leaves which makes great photo, no name, [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VZwpZWn8zhLqeS9A6).
### Scarborough Bluffs, Recommendation: 4
A half day trip would be nice here. [Address](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1zA79g6dgYtq9XhR8)
### ROM, Recommendation: 4
[Royal Ontario Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B7RG3XFPoR6b1LGRA)
### Yorkdale shopping mall, Recommendation: 3. [Address](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CwR7G4j6iTL4pLhd9)
Not a big fan of shopping mall but in case Jayita likes it!
### Grand Bend Beach, Recommendation: 3, [Address](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PJpccHpt58T1w1Zo8)
Place people spend a day near the lake.
### Point Pelee National Park, [Address](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pnUBHYmh3HRGnuex8)
The very south point of the Canada continent. It is almost the same of latitude with Crescent City, California!
### Nearby cities
- Ottawa: capital of Canada. [Parliament Hill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EcMV1NQy7qhxZc5p9) is like the white house in the US.
- Kingston: take a [Kingston 1000 Islands Cruises](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bc8hoYiemSjpcGb5A) to visit the 1000 islands! Bring your passport, if you want to visit a castle because the castle is in the US border.
- Montreal + Quebec: French speaking cities. Remember, do not right turn on red, if you are on the Montreal island.
