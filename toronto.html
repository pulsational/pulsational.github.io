# Hi Anshul, Welcome to Toronto!
This page serves as your personal tour guide, offering tips and highlighting several great places I've explored. Keep in mind, it's heavily influenced by my own preferences!
## Life in toronto
### Overview of Toronto
Toronto is a city that borders Lake Ontario to the south. However, when we say the word "Toronto", it could mean the Toronto city, or GTA: the Greater Toronto Area. GTA has several major cities:
- Toronto city
- North: Vaughan, Richmond Hill, Markham
- West: Brampton, Missisauga
### Transport
#### Highways
The highways are pretty simple to understand. 
- 401 and 404, two N-S bound HWYs
The south part of 404 is connecting to DVP(Don Valley Parkway) connecting to Toronto downtown.
- 401, QEW(Queen Elizabeth Way) two E-W bound HWYs. 
- The only highway with toll is 407: remember, **never take 407!**  
#### TTC, GO train and presto card
One prepaid presto card can be used to take TTC and Go train in case you need it. TTC includes subway and buses. If you live in the downtown Toronto, TTC is pretty convinient. You can find maps anywhere, such as [The official website](https://cdn.ttc.ca/-/media/Project/TTC/DevProto/Images/Home/Routes-and-Schedules/Landing-page-pdfs/TTC_SubwayStreetcarMap_2021-11.pdf?rev=b9ab97e4c76549549c0cb09c210c508e).
#### Rental cars
Enterprise and Avis you can use the company code to have a discount. Remember to bring you badge.
### Groceries
I am not very familiar with Downtown Toronto area but sure you can find many stores. Besides, there is a high chance you can find an authentic Indian market somewhere!
### Drugs and health care
Equivilant to CVS or Walgreen, in Canada we have "Shoppers Drug Mart". If you need any medicine, go for it. You may also want to find a family doctor that will provide basic health care if case you need any type of help. My previous health care is the [Atlas medical clinic](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ptazoYmzhW9ehCd5A), but it might be too far from your place.
