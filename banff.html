# Welcome to Banff/Jasper Anshul!
## Overview
The word "Banff" covers several regions, including several national parks such as Baff, Jasper, Glacie, Yoho etc. I will name the most attracting elements as lakes, mountains and animals. When planning a trip, especially with parents, keep in mind: don't stuff too many things in one day. The attractions are distant and driving in mountains requires more patient.

## Planning
You'll need to plan for several things ahead as banff is a bit special.
### Travelling

Nothing to say: car rental please. Also, there are shuttle buses in Banff town but they wont reach anywhere you want to go. 
**KEEP IN MIND**:
- the Lake Moraine and Lake Louise no longer accept personal vehicles anymore thus you will have to buy tickets. Official website [here](https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/banff/visit/parkbus/louise) but you will have other private run companies with slightly more expensive options.
- There will be a lot of driving around. Such as from Banff town to Lake Louise will cost you about 40-50 minutes without traffic. Save enough time when making plans.
### Living
Try Airbnb/booking or google map such as [this](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Banff+Park+Lodge+Resort+Hotel+%26+Conference+Centre/@51.181657,-115.5741415,15.55z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x5370ca45b47cd2c1:0xcd8d91eb39607182!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d51.17757!4d-115.57425!16s%2Fg%2F1vq9lzdy?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyNy4xIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDUzSAFQAw%3D%3D). Highly recommand to live in Cammore instead of Banff, because Banff town is pretty expensive while Cammore is a lot cheaper and not too far away from Banff town.
### Cloth
Rocky Mountains can be cold. Dress normally but be prepared for snowing. I suggest to have extra coats or jackets for everyone in your car.
